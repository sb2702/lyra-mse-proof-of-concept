# Decoding Lyra with Media Source Extensions

A super hacky Proof of concept of using new, neural audio codecs (like [Lyra](https://github.com/neuvideo/lyra-js)) for streaming audio on the web

Install the packages with 

```
yarn
```

Then run the demo

```
yarn demo:serve
```

And go to localhost:8080
